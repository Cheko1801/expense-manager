# expense-manager
Hello, community! This is my first personal project: a full-stack web application for managing business travel expenses and employee spending.  
Developed with **React** (frontend), **Spring Boot** (backend), and **PostgreSQL** (database).  
It allows employees to record expenses and administrators to approve, reject, and generate reports.
